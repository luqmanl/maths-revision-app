# maths-revision-app
This is my first major independent project completed during my A-Levels. I have an incredibly detailed set of documentation explaining the entire process of my application, including the analysis, design, user feedback and evaluation. As I have begun studying at university, I have found a significant number of improvements in my software development. 

Namely, my code style and commenting 'line by line' was inspired by how the A-Level is taught, but I have found that this is not usually good practice as it reduces readability. Other important aspects include improving the file management of my project and breaking down my program into multiple files. There are, of course, improvements in the efficacy of my solutions that can be made and I will be able to apply my knowledge of the time complexities of algorithms (which I am learning at university) during future projects.

I will try to use these improvements to ensure my future projects are more in line with what a professional developer would consider a well-executed project (no pun intended). Also, I will use GitHub to its full extent in developing future projects as I become more familiar with it.
